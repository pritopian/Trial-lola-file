Lola helps create mixtapes by shapeshifting web content. Our lives’ biggest subroutine is to share/receive a link and be asked “what do you think?”. Most of the time they end up in a forgotten folder because the content is not in a format that engages with you. With Lola, users can shapeshift web content to a format they enjoy (whilst retaining the spirit of the creators’ message) to experience the internet on their terms. Content created by anyone is adapted by social bots that reflect users’ likes. Eg) Get a mixtape of articles from WSJ, Techcrunch and TMZ explained via memes and Gen Z lingo in Cardi B’s voice. Override content format limitations of platforms, and personalise content consumption. I am looking for a more technical cofounder with domain expertise in ML & Differential Privacy. I am a generalist. This idea is a culmination of my learnings from building AI powered content creation tools at Microsoft, Snap and building digital public goods to enable private data sharing for model training as part of India Stack [iSpirt]. AI powered Content Creation:
The goal of content creation tools has put the burden of audience engagement on the creator. Realistically, no matter what AI powers supercharge UGC/publishers, broadcasted content remains impersonal for consumers. Lola flips this. Creators curate the content, Lola creates shapeshifts it to different formats without diluting the creator's message to broaden reach, engagement and make everything more fun. The mixtapes replace social media feeds.
Privacy Focused Social Network Monetization:
Personalization of content consumption cannot be achieved without using private data to train models. However, current social networks enforce vendor lock in and force users into one social feed algorithm. Lola host the privacy focused compute environment where users own their interest graph and personal data; they can share their data with any model provider:
a) For model training and earn dividends 
b) For personalising their social feeds and receiving specific services
Lola will earn a percentage from the data exchange transactions. 
Current social media companies are entrenched in their ad based models, making it hard to switch. But, I see data portability as a feature in social networks, a plus for consumers and model developers alike; specifically with laws that are emerging in countries like India that empower citizens with data ownership.
There are three primary income streams, each to be realised at different stages of the company [In the order of precedence]:


Mixtape Tools for Consumers:
Put specific content shapeshifting tools and modes behind the paywall
Mixtape Tools for Business:
Combine private data with personal data to deliver hyper-personalised mixtapes 
Monetization Marketplace for User Data with Privacy Guarantees
Marketplace to trade personal data for model training or for specific personalization modes with Lola taking % for facilitating the data exchange with privacy guarantees.


Right now the capabilities embedded in creating the mixtape are provided individually by different new age startups. 
The social experience of creating and sharing mixtapes don’t exist in social media platforms


Everyone in the social media & consumer world is solving the problem of content creation - giving creators AI power to supercharge UGC. With Lola, I want to flip that. Anyone can create/reference information - and Lola bots will personalize consumption based on the consumer preferences and broaden reach and  engagement.


Secondly, every platform is focused on ad based models (selling user data) or trying to veer into subscription models. Lola will focus on evolving the product into a marketplace where users can trade personal data with privacy guarantees:
Giving users the ability to own their interest graph, personal data and mixtape feed.
Receive dividends from sharing it for model training with privacy guarantees
Providing model developers a way to create custom models and sell it to both business and consumer users of Lola.
